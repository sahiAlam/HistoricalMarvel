            <h2>History of the magnificent The Taj Mahal</h2>
            <p>
              The entire idea behind constructing a monument like the Taj Mahal
              was about Shahjahan’s wife Mumtaz Mahal. It was in the year 1631
              that she died while birthing their 14th child and it was in her
              memory that Shahjahan decided to give the world a monument that
              will forever be etched in people’s minds as a symbol of love. And
              to answer in which year The Taj Mahal was built, it was in 1631
              that the construction of this monument commenced. Cravers,
              inlayers, dome-builders, calligraphers, stonecutters, masons, and
              artisans from all across Shahjahan’s empire and from some parts of
              Central Asia and Iran were called to construct the giant white
              beauty. And it took approximately 22 years to complete the
              construction of The Taj Mahal. As per historical records over
              1,000 elephants and 22,000 laborers played a role in building The
              Taj Mahal. The monument is completely made of white marble which
              was imported from Central Asia and also collected from various
              parts of India. And it was almost after an expense of 32 billion
              rupees that the construction of the Taj Mahal was done in the year
              1653.
            </p>
            <p>
              As soon as the construction of The Taj Mahal was complete,
              Shahjahan the mind behind The Taj Mahal was deposed by his son
              Aurangzeb and was put in Agra Fort under house arrest. Along with
              Mumtaz Mahal, Shahjahan is also entombed in the same mausoleum and
              was laid to rest beside his wife’s tomb. Moving further in
              history, almost during the end of the 19th century, Lord Curzon
              who was a British viceroy gave the orders for a restoration
              project to bring back the life of monuments that were damaged
              during the Indian rebellion of 1857, and the project was finished
              in 1908. The government officials and British soldiers blemished
              the beauty of The Taj Mahal and also took the lapis lazuli and
              other precious stones embellished in the monument. But with
              prevailing controversies and multiple scars on its beauty from the
              past, the glorious The Taj Mahal still stands tall and beautiful
              adding to the grandeur of India.

            <h2>Taj Mahal Design and Architecture</h2>
            <img
              src="./images/tajmahal2.jpg"
              alt="Tajmahal Design"
              class="full__width__img"
            />

            <p>
              On the banks of River Yamuna is the massive structure of The Taj
              Mahal situated which is said to have been built by over 22,000
              workmen. The marble and other construction materials along with
              the artisans came from all across Shahjahan’s reigning empire and
              other parts of the world. A good and ideal example of Persian,
              Indian, and Islamic architecture is what The Taj Mahal is all
              about. Along with the grand structure of The Taj Mahal, the tomb,
              mosque, gateway, and garden also make up the complete journey of
              The Taj Mahal.
            </p>
            <p>
              An area as large as 42 acres is what was required to build The Taj
              Mahal. The platform on which The Taj Mahal stands tall is 50
              meters in height and the four minarets stand tall at a height of
              137 feet along with the tomb at 58 meters height. In the east of
              The Taj Mahal, there is a guest house also known as the Naqqar
              Khana and on the west is a mosque. Both the mosque and the guest
              house are made up of beautiful red sandstone and a garden adorns
              The Taj Mahal complex which covers 580 meters*300 meters of the
              area. Islamic style of construction is followed throughout the
              architecture of the garden, and it is always green and
              well-watered.
            </p>

            <h2>Taj Mahal’s Gateway</h2>
            <img
              src="./images/tajmahal3.webp"
              alt="Tajmahal Design"
              class="full__width__img"
            />

            <p>
              In the year 1648, the construction of the main gate was completed
              which has a height of 30 meters and the upper portion of the
              gateway comprises Chhatris and you will notice the verses of the
              Holy Quran inscribed on the gateway. Silver was used for the
              construction of the gateway and there are letters carved on it.
              After stepping inside the gateway, you will come across a
              courtyard. For your information, during the course of the Mughal
              Era, every year on Mumtaz Mahal’s death anniversary, a huge amount
              of charity was done ever after Shahjahan’s reign as a king ended.
            </p>

            <h2>The Mosque of Taj Mahal</h2>
            <img
              src="./images/tajmahal4.webp"
              alt="Tajmahal Design"
              class="full__width__img"
            />

            <p>
              A mosque which is situated on the west of The Taj Mahal faces the
              Holy city of Mecca and as per renowned historians, Isa Muhammed is
              the one who is said to have constructed the mosque. You can easily
              notice two arches on the sides of the mosque and the exterior of
              the mosque has a portal known as Iwan. Along with it, the four
              kiosks and three domes are made up of marble. Talking about the
              interiors, the floors of the mosque are engraved with 569 prayer
              rugs which are made out of black marble and the walls adorn the
              name of Allah and verses from the Holy Quran. Another aspect of
              the mosque is the Mehrab which points to the direction of Mecca
              and it also has a Minbar from where the Maulanas deliver the
              Namaz. A stone of height19 feet by 6.5 feet is also present in the
              mosque which represents the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal, and the mosque
              also has a pool where the ablution is done before offering the
              prayers. The two towers present in the mosque are on the north and
              the south.
            </p>

            <h2>The Garden, Mausoleum, and Tomb</h2>
            <p>
              The garden present in the complex of The Taj Mahal has spiritual
              symbolism attached to it as the greenery represents the mention of
              paradise in the Holy Quran. As soon as you step inside the main
              gateway, you can see the garden which is stretched at an area of
              580 meters by 300 meters and it stands divided by 16 flower beds
              and two watercourses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you cross the garden, you can reach the tomb which is
              stretched in an area of 95 square meters and the entrance of the
              tomb begins with a double staircase. Four minarets, each of 137
              feet height surround the tomb and they are built in a way that if
              natural calamity or mishap occurs, they will not fall on the tomb.
              There are four letters engraved on the 4 minarets which when
              spelled together form Ar-Rahman which is amongst the many names of
              Allah. Below the tomb is the central chamber comprising of four
              rooms for the graves of other family members and it was Aurangzeb
              who modified the authentic screen to an octagonal screen that was
              embellished with precious stones and made of marble.
            </p>
            <p>
              The center of attraction of The Taj Mahal is the tomb and the dome
              of the tomb has 110 yards of circumference and 107 yards of
              height. The structure of the tomb symbolizes the union of earth
              and heaven and is constructed in Islamic style and the square
              structure on which the tomb is placed is symbolic of the universe.
            </p>

            <h2>Distance between Taj Mahal and Delhi, NCR</h2>
            <p>
              In a straight line, the distance between Agra and Delhi is 194
              kilometers and based on miles it is 120.5 miles. Usually, the time
              to cover this distance varies because of the curvatures of the
              road taken to reach the Taj Mahal. By road, the driving distance
              is 243 kilometers and 97 meters and it takes around 4 hours to

            <h2>India Gate History</h2>
            <p>
              This stunning structure which can be recognized from miles away is
              a brainchild of Sir Edwin Lutyens, the famous English architect.
              The construction of the India Gate was done by the Imperial War
              Graves Commission or IWCG. This organisation was established in
              1917 for the sole purpose of building graves and war memorials of
              the soldiers who died in the First World War. The foundation of
              India Gate was laid in February 1921 by the third son of Queen
              Victoria, the Duke of Connaught. After a period of ten years, the
              monument was inaugurated by Viceroy Lord Irwin who dedicated it to
              the nation and the upcoming generations of the country. Also known
              as the Delhi Memorial, it has the names of 13,000 soldiers who
              died during the war, inscribed on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1971, Bangladesh was formed and the Indo-Pak war led to the
              martyrdom of many Indian soldiers. In 1972, a new structure was
              added to the India Gate which is known as Amar Jawan Jyoti (in
              English, it means the Flame of the Immortal Soldier). This
              structure was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister of India,
              Indira Gandhi, and was established to pay tribute to those
              soldiers.
            </p>

            <h2>Design & Architecture of India Gate</h2>
            <p>
              As mentioned above, India Gate New Delhi was designed by Sir Edwin
              Lutyens who was a member of the IWCG. He was a very famous war
              memorial architect of that time. This structure was built without
              any religious prejudice and free of any cultural ornamentation. He
              avoided adding pointed arches to the structure because he did not
              want to include Asian motifs. So, India Gate’s architectural style
              is that of a triumphal arch which is similar to that of the
              Gateway of India in Mumbai and Arc de Triomphe in Paris.
            </p>
            <p>
              42 meters tall & 9.1 meters wide, the India Gate Delhi is placed
              right in the center of a hexagonal complex. The entire structure
              is made of red and yellow sandstone which was imported from
              Bharatpur.
            </p>
            <p>
              A canopy was constructed in the year 1936 which was made about 150
              meters towards the east side of the India Gate. This structure was
              built as a tribute to King George V, the former Emperor of India.
              It replaced the already built marble statue of King George V at
              that place.
            </p>
            <p>
              India Gate New Delhi also has a structure called Amar Jawan Jyoti
              which has a marble pedestal with a cenotaph on top of it. The
              words ‘Amar Jawan’ are written on all four sides of the cenotaph
              in golden letters. It also has an installation of a reversed rifle
              which is capped by a soldier helmet. The Amar Jawan Jyoti has
              flames burning around it on all four sides permanently, which is
              fuelled by CNG.

                Hazarduari Palace, earlier known as the Bara Kothi,[1] is
                located in the campus of Kila Nizamat in Murshidabad, in the
                Indian state of West Bengal. It is situated near the bank of
                river Ganges. It was built in the nineteenth century by
                architect Duncan Macleod, under the reign of Nawab Nazim Humayun
                Jah of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa (1824–1838).

              In 1985, the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) disclosed several
              facts about Hazarduari Palace, including its old name called Bara
              Kothi. This also amazed the people stating that it's impossible to
              figure out the actual worth of the historical architect in today's
              scenario.
            </p>

            <p>
              West Bengal of India is a state that is enriched with a solid
              historical background still holding one of the rich cultural
              importance with its celebrations, art, literature, and cuisine.
              Similarly, the state has Hazarduari Palace, a well-known
              architecture that signifies the beauty, art, and culture of
              Murshidabad and its bygone days.
            </p>

            <h2>All About Hazarduari Palace, Murshidabad</h2>
            <p>
              The most popular thing about Hazarduari Palace is its thousand
              doors in which actual doors only count to 900, but the other 100
              doors are unreal. The basic idea behind the structure was the
              security of the people living inside the palace so that no
              invaders could attack them from outside the campus border.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was constructed to misguide the invaders who would struggle
              to find the actual door to get inside the palace and help the
              Nawab's army escape and plan a foolproof strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
              From 1824 to 1838, the Nawab Nazim Humayun Jah was the ruler of
              Bengal, owning the Hazarduari Palace. Since then, the palace has
              been one of India's historical artefacts and assets that has
              enormously benefited the nation to promote its fine art, revealing
              the ruler's lifestyle and brave stories to the tourists.
            </p>

            <h2>What's Inside the Hazarduari Palace?</h2>
            <p>
              Inside the palace, a museum has a great collection of antiques,
              old furniture, treasured paintings, tools, instruments, and more.
              You will find the Muhammad- i-Beg's dagger with which he killed
              Siraj-ud-Dualah. Along with this, a palanquin was used by Mughal
              emperor Aurangzeb's daughter Zebunissa.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are historical books from where you can learn about the
              palace. Here you could also see the precious hookah carved with
              marble along with the silver throne of Nawab Feradun Jah.
            </p>
            <p>
              Including this, some artworks of French, Italian, and Dutch
              artists can also be seen. Undoubtedly, Murshidabad Hazarduari is
              worth visiting to reveal the old mysteries and engage with
              mesmerising artefacts.

              Political Significance of the Hazarduari Palace, West Bengal
            </h2>
            <p>
              West Bengal is the hub of Indian history that connects to the
              political importance of Murshidabad Hazarduari Palace. This old

              Inside the palace, the old artwork and vintage furniture speak a
              lot about the taste of Nawab. One who visits the palace could feel
              the ancient days closely.

            <h2>Facts About the Hazarduari Palace</h2>
            <h5>The Mystery Mirror</h5>
            <p>
              Interestingly, Hazarduari Palace has a mystery mirror where the
              person who stands in front of it cannot see themselves, but others
              can. The mirror was planned to be placed at 90 degrees.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reason behind this was to mislead the invaders who could harm
              the Nawab before they could realise that they were the target.
              This magic mirror is placed outside the gallery, and visitors try
              the experiment to know the story's relevance.
            </p>

            <h5>The Nizamat Imambara</h5>
            <p>
              This wooden Imambara went through an accident and caught fire
              completely. Due to this, the first Imambara built did not exist
              after 1848.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, it was rebuilt after two years. And the Nizamat Imambara
              is still listed under the title of India's biggest Imambara.
            </p>

            <h5>Bacchawali Tope</h5>
            <p>
              Bacchawali is a canon that may look ordinary to you but holds a
              strong and distinctive reason for its structure. As the name
              suggests, it is connected to a pregnant woman or a woman who has
              just given birth to a baby.
            </p>
            <p>
              The weight of this cannon is 7657kg, where 18 kilograms of
              gunpowder is needed for a single shot. And you will be amazed to
              know that this cannon has been used just once to date.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is because the loud volume it generated could make any
              pregnant woman deliver the child within 10 miles radius.
            </p>

            <h5>The Crystal Chandelier</h5>
            <p>
              The Crystal Chandelier is a sign of royalty that nobody can deny.
              And when it comes to exploring a place like Hazar Duari, then you
              must not miss the chance of being under the world's second-largest
              chandelier after the one in Buckingham Palace.
            </p>
            <p>
              This astonishing chandelier had thousand and one lit candles back
              when there was no electricity. Ninety-six electric bulbs have now
              replaced these candles after urbanisation. Queen Victoria gifted
              it to the Nawab, which still adds antiquity to the palace's
              beauty.
            </p>
            <h5>The Madina Mosque</h5>
            <p>
              Madina Mosque was built by Nawab Siraj-ud-Dualah, situated close
              to the Nizamat Imambara. Fortunately, the mosque escaped the fire
              caught by the Imambara due to its proximity.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is said that the soil used for its construction was mixed with
              the soil brought from Mecca. The primary reason behind this was to
              let the inferior local Muslim community embrace the feeling of
              Hajj.

                Surya is the Hindu sun god, and the Konark Sun Temple is
                dedicated to him. The temple was established in the 13th century
                and is situated 35 km northeast of Puri city on the Puri
                district coastline of Orissa, India. King Narasimhadeva
                accredited the Konark mandir I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty
                around 1250 CE. In this old-world heritage shrine you will find
                all the elements of a Hindu temple as well as extensive
                iconography inside out.

            <h2>What is the Konark Sun Temple?</h2>
            <p>
              Before moving into the past of the Konark temple’s history, let’s
              first overview a bit about this temple. Experiencing the grandeur
              and enormity of Orissa, people like to visit this historical
              Konark temple built by Narasimhadeva I. It is a must-visit if you
              travel to Orissa as it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
            </p>
            <p>
              The name Konark is derived from combining two Sanskrit words, Kona
              (corner or angle) and Arka (the Sun). The Konark of Odisha forms a
              bilateral triangle with the Puri Jagannath temple and the Lingaraj
              temple of Bhubaneswar. Amongst all three temples, the Konark
              Odisha temple forms the Kona (corner) of the triangle. The Konark
              stands as a classic example of the old age Hindu temple
              architecture and represents the colossal structure, artwork on
              myriad themes, and sculptures that draw a lot of tourists from all
              over the world.
            </p>

            <h2>A Brief History of the Konark Sun Temple</h2>
            <p>
              The history of Konark Sun Temple takes you back to the 19th
              century BC. The angle of the temple defines its name, from where
              the sun rises. This sun temple is located in the historical place
              of Kalinga, which includes significant areas of Orissa and
              different parts of Chattisgarh, West Bengal, and Andhra Pradesh,
              which was ruled by the Eastern Dynasty kingdom from the 5th to
              15th century AD. It is amongst the most intense dynasties of
              India, initiating the existence of majestic temples like Puri
              Jagannath Temple and Konark Temple.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Konark temple was constructed by King Narasimhadeva I in 1244
              to worship Surya, the sun god of the Hindus. The place Konark was
              selected to build the sun temple, as the site is considered a holy
              seat based on various ancient texts.
            </p>

            <h2>What are the Konark Wheels of Sun Temple?</h2>
            <p>
              The Konark Sun Temple is located on the Chandrabhaga river. The
              world heritage site is also known as the Black Pagoda because it
              was made of black granite stones. It is an enormous erotic
              sculpture which is demonstrating several couples making love in
              different postures. Also, the time wheels engraved in stones are
              depict the hours of the day as the sun changes positions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many beautiful images inscribed on the walls, roof, and time wheel
              of the temple attract tourists to this ancient worship site. It is
              a unique temple that boldly depicts the man-woman relationship as
              a part of life. The romantic couples and women are beautifully
              carved on the stones of the 12 richly adorned pairs of wheels.
              This evergreen beauty is located at the temple's base, which never
              fails to attract the visitor’s attention.
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides the art on the stone, what’s unique about these big ornate
              wheels is that they tell us the time of the day. The wheel's
              radius creates the sundial with the spokes, and each wheel has
              eight thinner spokes and eight wider spokes. Out of all 24 wheels,
              six are on either side of the main Konark temple, two wheels are
              on the eastern front, and four wheels are on either side of the
              Mukhasala.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can calculate the exact time of the day by looking at the
              shadows cast by the spokes of the Konark wheels. As per the Konark
              sun temple information, it is believed that the Konark wheels also
              represent the zodiac signs. Some researchers claimed that the
              wheels at Konark Surya temple are the same as the Dharmachakra of
              Buddhists, the Wheel of Karma or the Wheel of the Law.
            </p>

            <h2>The Architecture and Design of the Konark Sun Temple</h2>
            <p>
              The Konark Sun Temple architecture displays the peculiar style of
              Kalinga and Orissa, which is a reflection of the Nagara style of
              Hindu temple architecture. Nagara is one of the three styles of
              Hindu temple architecture.
            </p>

            <img

              alt="Template Place"
              class="full__width__img"
            />

            <p>
              The Konark temple beautifully characterises Nagara-style
              architecture with a square ground plan and a sanctuary and
              assembly hall (mandapa). A big curvilinear tower is known as a
              shikhara at the peak, inclining inwards and capped.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Konark sun temple is entirely built of stone with 12 pairs of
              lavishly-ornamented wheels in the form of a colossal chariot.
              Seven richly-caparisoned, galloping horses draw the stones.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Konark Sun Temple architecture depicts the Hindu beliefs that
              have invariably become part of the antique artistic creation
              associated with the sun god in India, along with 12 wheels that
              represent the 12 months of the year.
            </p>

            <h2>Cultural Touchstone of Konark Surya temple</h2>
            <p>
              Today, this historical worshipping site isn’t just renowned among
              tourists but serves as a cultural festival and classical dance
              performance venue. The cultural relevance of the Konark Sun Temple
              is depicted on the reverse side of the Indian currency note of 10
              rupees to portray its importance to Indian cultural heritage.
              Amongst 32 world heritage sites in India, Konark Sun Temple was
              declared a cultural heritage site by UNESCO in 1984.
            </p>

            <h2>Wrapping it Up</h2>
            <p>
              Ganga dynasty king Narasimha Deva built the Konark temple to
              worship the Hindu god Sun. The temple was constructed and designed
              in a unique Nagara Hindu temple architectural style with different
              stones. The Konark temple's history details its importance from
              construction and decay to its restoration and present cultural
              relevance among the tourists. The Konark Sun Temple is an immense
              cultural heritage of India which still defines its name and is
              built. Hence, you must not skip visiting this heritage site when
              planning your visit to Orissa, and it is better to learn about its
              history in advance to relate it when you pay a visit to Konark Sun
              Temple.

            <h2>History of Victoria Memorial</h2>
            <p>
              The Victoria Memorial, the most famous building in Kolkata is the
              result of Lord Curzon’s brain who was once the Viceroy of India
              under British rule. It was in the year 1901 when the then Empress
              of British India died, Lord Curzon decided to honour her with the
              construction of a grand memorial monument. The proposal was to
              build the memorial as a stately edifice and for the visitors to
              have a look at the past marvels. In 1906, the foundation stone of
              Victoria Memorial was kept by the Prince of Wales who afterwards
              became King George V on January 4th. Victoria Memorial was
              officially inaugurated in 1921 and thereafter opened for public
              visits. Later, after India became independent, there were multiple
              additions done to Victoria Mahal.
            </p>

            <h2>The Enticing Victoria Memorial Architecture</h2>
            <p>
              If you think a specific type of architecture suffices the
              structure, then let us tell you that it’s the amalgamation of
              multiple styles of architecture. The prominent one is the
              Indo-Saracenic style displaying the elements of both British and
              Mughal architecture. Also, the monument hints at some Egyptian,

              Talking about the design, Victoria Memorial is inspired by the
              majestic Taj Mahal. The design elements incorporated in the
              architecture are one central dome, four other domes, a terrace,
              chhatris shaped like octagonal domes, and high portals. On top of
              the central dome, there is a statue of the Angel of Victory which
              is 16 feet high. A lot of allegorical sculptures can also be
              noticed, for instance, the north porch showcases learning,
              motherhood, and prudence.
